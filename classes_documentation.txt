CLASSES DOCUMENTATION
====================

1. PACKET CLASS
--------------
Objective: Represents a network packet with its properties

Attributes:
- packet_id: Unique identifier for the packet
- data_length: Size of packet data in bytes
- creation_time: When the packet was created
- arrival_time: When the packet arrived
- start_processing_time: When processing began
- completion_time: When processing completed
- delete_time: When packet was deleted

2. EVENT LOGGER
--------------
Objective: Handles logging of simulation events with thread-safe operations

Main Methods:
- __init__(start_time)
  Parameters:
  * start_time: Simulation start time

- log_event(event)
  Parameters:
  * event: Event message to log

3. NETWORK LINK
--------------
Objective: Represents a network link with transmission capabilities

Main Methods:
- __init__(speed, latency=0.1)
  Parameters:
  * speed: Transmission speed in bytes per second
  * latency: Network delay in seconds

- transmit_packet(packet, sim_start_time)
  Parameters:
  * packet: Packet to transmit
  * sim_start_time: Simulation start time

4. PACKET QUEUE
--------------
Objective: Thread-safe queue for managing network packets

Main Methods:
- __init__(capacity, processing_speed=200000)
  Parameters:
  * capacity: Maximum queue size
  * processing_speed: Processing speed in bytes per second

- enqueue(packet)
  Parameters:
  * packet: Packet to add to queue

- dequeue()
  Purpose: Remove and return first packet

- process_packets(sim_start_time)
  Parameters:
  * sim_start_time: Simulation start time

5. STATISTICS COLLECTOR
----------------------
Objective: Collects and plots simulation statistics

Main Methods:
- record_statistics(current_time, queue)
  Parameters:
  * current_time: Current simulation time
  * queue: Packet queue to analyze

- plot_statistics()
  Purpose: Generate plots of collected statistics

6. SIMULATION
------------
Objective: Main simulation class that coordinates the entire process

Main Methods:
- __init__(queue_capacity, network_speed, generation_speed=0.05, csv_file="packets.csv")
  Parameters:
  * queue_capacity: Maximum queue size
  * network_speed: Network transmission speed
  * generation_speed: Time between packet generation
  * csv_file: Input data file

- generate_packets()
  Purpose: Generate packets with specified intervals

- process_packets()
  Purpose: Process packets from the queue

- run()
  Purpose: Execute the simulation

Note: This is a network simulation system that models packet transmission and processing
with various performance metrics and visualization capabilities.

1. STUDENT CLASS
---------------
Objective: Represents a student's information in the system

Main Methods:
- __init__(id, name, age, grade, major, gpa)
  Parameters:
  * id: Student's unique ID number
  * name: Student's full name
  * age: Student's age
  * grade: Current grade level
  * major: Field of study
  * gpa: Grade Point Average

2. STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
---------------------------
Objective: Handles all student data operations and storage

Main Methods:
- __init__(db_file)
  Parameters:
  * db_file: Path to database file

- add_student(student)
  Parameters:
  * student: Student object to add

- update_student(student_id, updated_data)
  Parameters:
  * student_id: ID of student to update
  * updated_data: New student information

- delete_student(student_id)
  Parameters:
  * student_id: ID of student to remove

3. STUDENT MANAGEMENT APP
------------------------
Objective: Provides the graphical user interface for the system

Main Methods:
- __init__(root)
  Parameters:
  * root: Main application window

- add_student()
  Purpose: Creates new student record

- update_student()
  Purpose: Updates existing student information

- delete_student()
